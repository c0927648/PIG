1. Load the dataset into Pig, defining an appropriate schema for the data


purchase = LOAD '/user/maria_dev/customer_purchases.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS(customer_id:int,purchase_date:chararray,product_id:int,product_name:chararray,quantity:int,total_amount:double);

my_limit = LIMIT purchase 10;

dump my_limit; 


2. Calculate Total Purchase Amount per Customer: 

group_customer = GROUP purchase BY customer_id;

total_purchase = FOREACH group_customer GENERATE group AS customer_id, 
SUM (purchase.total_amount) AS total_amount;

***to dump with limit*

limit_10 = LIMIT total_purchase 10;

dump limit_10; 


3. Find the Most Purchased Product:

group_product = GROUP purchase BY (product_id, product_name);

max_purchase = FOREACH group_product GENERATE group AS product_id, SUM (purchase.quantity) AS Total_Quantity;

order_desc = ORDER max_purchase BY Total_Quantity DESC;

4. Calculate Average Purchase Amount per Customer:

group_customer = GROUP purchase  BY customer_id;

avg_customer = FOREACH group_customer GENERATE group AS customer_id, AVG (purchase.total_amount) AS Average_Spending;


5. Identify High-Value Customers - Determine customers who have made purchases with a total amount greater than $100.

group_customer = GROUP purchase BY customer_id;

filtered_data =  FILTER purchase BY total_amount >= 100;

high_pay = FOREACH filtered_data GENERATE customer_id, total_amount;



6. Sort Customers by Purchase Frequency: 

group_customer = GROUP purchase BY customer_id;

frequency= FOREACH group_customer GENERATE group AS customer_id, COUNT (purchase) AS total_pur;

sorted = ORDER frequency by total_pur DESC;

7.Generate a Report 

customer ID, total purchase amount,most purchased product, average purchase amount, and whether the customer is a high-value customer.

group_customer = GROUP purchase BY (customer_id,product_name);

final_report = FOREACH group_customer GENERATE group AS customer_id, SUM (purchase.total_amount) AS Total_amount, SUM (purchase.quantity) AS Total_Quantity, AVG (purchase.total_amount) AS Average_Spending;

without the product name:

group_customer = GROUP purchase BY customer_id;
